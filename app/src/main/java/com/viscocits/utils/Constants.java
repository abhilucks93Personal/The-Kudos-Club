It is the User&rsquo;s responsibility to check their User Account regularly to ensure that all Kudos Points expected to be allocated have been credited and that the resultant Account Balance is accurate and conforms to their expectations. Users must inform their Value Champion or the Reward team if they identify that any Kudos Points have been inaccurately applied to their Account Balance immediately on discovery of the same.&nbsp;<br /><br />3.3 Any Kudos TimePoints awarded under the Recognition Pillar can be used only for Time off and cannot be exchanged or transferred for the online catalogue.

                    "            accounts with Kudos Points without notice as required to operate the Online Catalogue and to undertake the exchange of Kudos Points for the supply of Goods.Additionally, an Account Balance may be amended without notice where Goods have been returned, redemption requests cancelled or errors and omissions identified.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.2 Should a User disagree with any adjustments made to their Account Balance they should contact the Reward or the Avinity team immediately and allow opportunity for explanation and remedy.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the redemption of Kudos Points by an individual User does not constitute a transaction of sale as laid down by and governed by prevailing Distance Selling Regulations and other appropriate legislature as may be effective or introduced from time to time. In so far as is possible such consumer orientated legislation is excluded from these Terms recognizing that no monetary transaction takes place between the User and Avinity. Any Sale Transaction rests exclusively between GVC and Avinity.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.4 Avinity will manage the selection of all Goods against which Users may redeem Kudos Points. Avinity will review product range on a regular agreed basis, however will not be responsible for any bespoke request or claims related to product range by Users.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.5 All goods available on the Online Catalogue are offered subject to availability.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.6 Without exception the specific number of Kudos Points required to be redeemed by a User to acquire certain Goods will be attributed to all items offered via the Online Catalogue and will be designated the Goods&rsquo;\n" +
                    "            Points Value (&ldquo;Points Value&rdquo;).&nbsp;<br /><br />4.7 Points Values may be subject to variation from time to time. Avinity reserves the right at any time to revise the prices and information within the Online Catalogue without notice.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.8 The User is responsible for the accuracy of any request for the redemption of Kudos Points and any confirmation arising, and that they have sufficient Kudos Points to acquire the Goods; if the User&rsquo;s Account Balance holds insufficient Kudos Points, Avinity will not accept the redemption request.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.9 Notwithstanding the above, upon receiving a request for the redemption of Kudos Points, subject to confirmation that the User&rsquo;s account holds sufficient Kudos Points to warrant and authorise the redemption, Avinity will undertake to reduced the User&rsquo;s Account Balance by the necessary Points Value of the Goods.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.10 When the redemption transaction has been effected, Avinity will confirm to the User that an order (&ldquo;Order&rdquo;) has been created. This will be communicated by way of written communication, by electronic means or by post, to the address recorded in the User&rsquo;s Account.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.11 Thereafter, Avinity seeks to affect delivery of Goods Ordered within 14-21 days, however up to 28 days should be allowed for the receipt of any Order as delay in delivery is sometimes outside of our control.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.12 Should the User&rsquo;s requested Goods be unavailable, as a result of circumstances beyond the control of Avinity or shortages of supply that would call the 28 day maximum delivery cycle into question, the User will be notified at the earliest instance. The User will be entitled to immediately cancel the existing Order and receive a full refund of any Kudos Points redeemed. Avinity will look to assist the User in identifying a comparative product that the User may desire to have in substitution. If the User decides to exchange Kudos Points for an alternative product, the original Order will be taken as void and a new Order will be brought in to force pertaining specifically to the alternative goods. This new Order will be seen as separate to and unconnected with the User&rsquo;s original Order. However, should the User be unwilling to accept any alternative Product proposed, or should an alternative be unavailable, Avinity undertakes that they will credit the User&rsquo;s Account Balance with the Points Value originally redeemed.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.13 These terms and conditions apply solely to the Goods afforded, represented and offered in exchange for Kudos Points directly via the Online Catalogue to the User.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.14 Avinity affords to its Users or makes references to the services of external organizations for the purpose of delivering the Online Catalogue. However, Avinity does not warrant nor will it accept any responsibility for the content or services provided by Avinity Partners, other third parties or their agents including the activities commercial or otherwise of an Avinity Partner. The existence of such references, links and associations do not constitute or represent any endorsement or other acceptance of responsibility of liability by Avinity for any Goods or services afforded by such third parties, be they Avinity Partners or others.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.15 Avinity reserve the right to cancel any Order if: -<br />a.) there is insufficient stock to deliver the Goods ordered;<br />b.) delivery is not undertaken to the Users Delivery Address location;<br />c.) the User has insufficient Points in their Account Balance&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />4.16 If Avinity do cancel an Order, we will notify the affected User by an appropriate written medium. Any Kudos Points debited by us from the User&rsquo;s Account Balance will be credited to the User&rsquo;s Account Balance. Avinity are not obliged to offer any additional compensation for disappointment suffered.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.17 Your Right to Cancel. Prior to the dispatch of an Order, or any Goods pertaining to be part of an Order, the User may withdraw from their request to redeem Kudos Points in exchange for the Goods at any time. The User does not need to give any reason for withdrawing from the Order nor will they be liable for any penalty. If Goods have been dispatched to a User&rsquo;s Delivery Address prior to the receipt of notification of an order cancellation, the User must return the Goods to their country&rsquo;s Goods Supplier and pay any costs associated with doing so.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.18 Once a User has notified us that they are withdrawing from an Order, any Kudos Points deducted from their Account Balance will be credited as soon as is practicable and in any event within 14 days beginning with the day on which notice of cancellation was given PROVIDED THAT the Goods in question are returned and received by the Goods Supplier during this term in the condition and packaging they were in when dispatched in so far as all original packaging remains unopened (which extends to any software, CDs or DVD supplied as Goods where the seals thereto must remain intact); otherwise we reserve the right not to credit the User Account involved.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.19 Your right to cancel is expressly excluded, and does not apply, to any Goods which are supplied personalized or customized to your specific specifications, perishable or date dependant items.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.20 Users agree that the Online Catalogue can pass personal information to third parties including local Goods Suppliers exclusively for the purpose of supplying Goods requested in exchange for the redemption of Kudos Points;&nbsp;<br /><br />4.21 Delivery of Goods can only be arranged to the location specified in a User Account (the &ldquo;Delivery Address&rdquo;).&nbsp;<br /><br />4.22 All Goods offered clearly define whether the cost of carriage, delivery and/or installation is excluded from the Points Value attributable to the Goods.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.23 If delivery cannot be made to the Delivery Address for any reason Avinity reserve the right to deliver the Goods to the local GVC office address or such other address as may be notified to the User in writing, and at the time of notification this address will become the Delivery Address.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.24 Avinity accepts no liability for costs incurred whether, and without limitation, they are actual, contingent or otherwise that are payable as a result of the transfer of Goods between locations. These include additional taxes, duties or other levies.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.26 We regret that we are unable to specify exact delivery dates and timeslots, due to the varying nature of the carrier arrangements in place. Any dates given for delivery are approximate only and Avinity shall not be liable for any losses, costs, damages, charges or expenses caused by any delay in delivering the goods unless cause by our negligence.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.27 Avinity may at our discretion and expense deliver parts of any Order separately.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.28 A User will become the owner of the Goods requested in exchange for the redemption of Kudos Points once they have been delivered to the User&rsquo;s Delivery Address. Once the Goods have been delivered we will no longer have any responsibility for any loss or damage to the Goods.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.29 In the majority of cases, a signature will be required upon delivery of the Goods to confirm receipt and to effect release from responsibilities. The name conveyed in the signature may be quoted verbally to the User by way of confirmation of delivery and, if necessary, the User must take all reasonable steps to identify this person should they be an individual who is later identified as being unconnected with the User or the transaction. A receipt signed at the Delivery Address shall be deemed to be conclusive evidence of receipt of the Goods.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.30 We cannot offer and deliver certain Goods to persons under the age of eighteen (18), e.g. alcohol, knives and certain videos and software. For this reason, Orders for these products may not be transferred from the User to any other person.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.31 If you do not receive the Goods ordered by you within 28 days of the date on which you requested the redemption of Kudos Points for them, you must notify Avinity within 35 days of the date on which you placed your request for the redemption of Kudos Points.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.32 If the Goods we deliver are not what you ordered, or are damaged or defective prior to the point of delivery, or the delivery is of the incorrect quantity, notify Avinity immediately, within 24 hours of delivery. By doing so we can:&nbsp;<br />a.) Make good any shortage or non-delivery; or<br />b.) Replace or repair any Goods that are damaged or defective; or<br />c.) Refund to the User Account from which Kudos Points were redeemed an equivalent amount of Kudos Points as exchanged for the Goods.<br /><br /><br />4.33 Whilst every care has been made to ensure the accuracy of information, all drawings, images, illustrations, descriptive material, specifications and advertising within the Online Catalogue are for the sole purpose of giving an approximate description of the Goods offered. They are provided exclusively to assist you in making a decision should you decide to undertake the redemption and exchange of Kudos Points.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.34 We do not represent or warrant the accuracy or reliability of any of the information or content about any Goods or services be it factual or illustrative, software or advertisements (together, the &ldquo;Materials&rdquo;) advertised, promoted or offered for sale, contained within, distributed through, downloaded or accessed from such media as is associated with the Online Catalogue.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.35 All design, text, illustrations and images together with the selection, arrangement and layout thereof are owned and are the copyright of Avinity or of our Avinity Partners, Suppliers or connected parties, which are used under license.

Governing Body<br /></strong>5.1 Failure by us to enforce any of these terms and conditions will not affect our right to enforce any of the remaining terms and conditions.&nbsp;<br /><br />5.2 If any provision of these terms is declared by any judicial or any other competent authority to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary or deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.&nbsp;<br /><br />5.3 These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.
